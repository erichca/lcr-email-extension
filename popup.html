	<h3>Why to use</h3>

	<p>This tool helps you extract e-mail addresses from the Recipients field in the Send a Message tool in LCR so you can copy and paste the e-mail addresses and send from your personal e-mail account instead. This is useful because when e-mail is sent from LCR directly, it is often blocked by cloud providers as spam and members don't see the e-mails.</p>
    
  <h3>How to use</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Use the <a href="https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org/messaging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Leader and Clerk Resources Send a Message Tool</a> to add all desired recipients to the message you are composing. Once you have all the recipients you want in the Recipients box, you can use this tool.</li>
  <li>You will see in the box all the recipients e-mail addresses in a form you can select and copy. Click in the box below and select all (click in it and press Ctrl+A) then copy your selection to the clipboard (press Ctrl+C)</li>
  <li>Finally go to your favorite e-mail client, compose a new message there, and paste (Ctrl+V) the e-mail addresses you copied into the 'Bcc:' field. Try not to use the To: or CC: field as these reveal e-mail addresses to all senders on the e-mail.</li>
</ul>

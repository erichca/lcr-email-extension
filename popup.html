	<h3>Why to Use</h3>

	<p>This tool helps when e-mail you send from LCR gets blocked or sent to spam by certain cloud providers.  You can use this extension to copy the e-mail addresses a message would be sent to in LCR and instead send the message from your own personal e-mail account where it is less likely to be blocked.  Always put these e-mail addresses in the BCC line.</p>

  <h3>How to Use</h3>

	<p>First, use the <a href = "https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org">Leader and Clerk Resources</a> Send a Message tool to select all the recipients for your message.</p>
  <p>Then, click on the LCR EMail Helper extension icon <img src="icon.png"/> in the toolbar (you clicked it to bring up this message).</p>
  <li>Click in the box below and select all (click in it and press Ctrl+A)</li>
  <li>Copy your selection to the clipboard (press Ctrl+C)</li>
  <li>Then go to your favorite e-mail client, compose a new message, and paste (Ctrl+V) the e-mail addresses you copied into the 'Bcc:' field.  Try not to use the To: or CC: field as these reveal e-mail addresses to all senders on the e-mail.</li>

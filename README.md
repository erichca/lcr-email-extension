Edge extension to extract e-mail addresses from LCR send mail tool

This tool helps when e-mail you send from LCR gets blocked or sent to spam by certain cloud providers.  You can use this extension to copy the e-mail addresses a message would be sent to in LCR and instead send the message from your own personal e-mail account where it is less likely to be blocked.  Always put these e-mail addresses in the BCC line.</p>

# How to Use

First, use the [Leader and Clerk Resources Send a Message tool](https://lcr.churchofjesuschrist.org) to select all the recipients for your message.

Then, click on the LCR EMail Helper extension icon the toolbar (you clicked it to bring up this message).

Click in the box below and select all (click in it and press Ctrl+A)

Copy your selection to the clipboard (press Ctrl+C)

Then go to your favorite e-mail client, compose a new message, and paste (Ctrl+V) the e-mail addresses you copied into the 'Bcc:' field.  Try not to use the To: or CC: field as these reveal e-mail addresses to all senders on the e-mail.
